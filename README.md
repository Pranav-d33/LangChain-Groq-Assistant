# LangChain-Groq-Assistant

A Python-based assistant integrating LangChain and Groq for advanced language and AI workflows.

## Overview

This repository is designed for building and managing conversational AI assistants using [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) and [Groq](https://groq.com/). It is tailored for developers interested in leveraging LLMs (Large Language Models) for natural language applications, automation, and custom assistant solutions.

> **Note:** The repository currently contains Python code and dependencies, as well as integrations with HuggingFace Hub for model and dataset management.

## Features

- **LangChain Integration:** Compose, chain, and manage complex LLM tasks.
- **Groq Support:** Utilize Groq hardware/software for high-speed inference and AI workloads.
- **HuggingFace Hub:** Seamless interaction with model repositories and datasets.
- **Command-Line & Programmatic Use:** Suitable for both CLI utilities and Python scripts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or above
- `pip` (Python package manager)
- A HuggingFace account (for model access, if required)
- (Optional) Access to Groq hardware or Groq Cloud if using Groq acceleration

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Pranav-d33/LangChain-Groq-Assistant.git
    cd LangChain-Groq-Assistant
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
